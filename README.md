# Rodriguez_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final Project for CSCI2270

This will be a program that reads in a list that will contain bars local to a city. The list will show have distances corresponding to the bars. The user will be able to select how many bars they would like to visit throughout the night, and the application will calculate and output which bars would be optimal based on shortest total distance. This program will basically allow users to plan a "pub crawl".
