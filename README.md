# Rodriguez_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final Project for CSCI2270

This will be a program that calculates current and projected grades in classes, and accepts user input to modify the types of assignments and their weights. It will then prompt the user for a "goal" (i.e. aiming for a B in a given class) and will determine that average grades needed for assignments that have not yet been completed.
